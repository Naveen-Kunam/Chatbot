	<img src="images/download4.png" width=500px height=300px align="right"/>
	<h2><p>CSE comprises of the basic knowledge of computer programming and networking. The computer science experience will give ample knowledge about the implementation design and management of the entire information system in both the aspects- hardware as well as software. As the name suggests, this is a study which encompasses the theory of computation and the design and implementation of the computational systems. This is a course which is offered all over the globe in the best of the technical institutions and a student can do graduation as well as post-graduation degrees. As part of the programme, students get to learn about developing hardware as well as software systems for the computers and they also gain ample knowledge over the communication systems and other similar devices. </p></h2><br/><br/>
	
	<h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING(Artificial intelligence and machine learning):</h1>
	<img src="images/download5.png" width=500px height=300px align="left"/>
	<h2><p>Artificial intelligence (AI), also known as machine intelligence, is a branch of computer science that aims to imbue software with the ability to analyze its environment using either predetermined rules and search algorithms, or pattern recognizing machine learning models, and then make decisions based on those analyses.<br/>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.</p></h2><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
	
	<h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERIG(Cyber Security):</h1>
	<img src="images/download6.png" width=500px height=300px align="right"/>
	<h2><p>The confluence of academia and industries is inevitable in the growing field of Computer Science. HITS, has come out with a novel solution of running B.Tech courses aligned with industrial standards along with the industrial leader IBM.
	Cyber Security specialization will provide a deeply engaging learning experience with interesting real-world applications. Cyber Security and Forensics gives a better understanding of protecting your data from cyber-attacks with proper risk management and mitigation. The B.Tech Programme with specialization on Cyber Security and Forensics will have professional core courses from Computer Science and Engineering and electives courses in Cyber Security and Digital Forensics, which are exclusively designed by IBM. Upon successful completion of the course, every student will receive a digital badge from IBM along with the degree from HITS, which is an added credential and gives them an edge over other students.</p></h2><br/><br/><br/>

	<h1>COMPUTER SCIENCE & ENGINEERING(Data Science):</h1>
	<img src="images/download7.png" width=500px height=300px align="left"/>
	<h2><p>Data science is the field of study that combines domain expertise, programming skills, and knowledge of mathematics and statistics to extract meaningful insights from data. Data science practitioners apply machine learning algorithms to numbers, text, images, video, audio, and more to produce artificial intelligence (AI) systems to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence. In turn, these systems generate insights which analysts and business users can translate into tangible business value.More and more companies are coming to realize the importance of data science, AI, and machine learning. Regardless of industry or size, organizations that wish to remain competitive in the age of big data need to efficiently develop and implement data science capabilities or risk being left behind.</p></h2><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

	<h1>ELECTRONICS & COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING:</h1>
	<img src="images/download8.png" width=500px height=300px align="right"/>
	<h2><p>Electronics and Communications Engineering (ECE) involves researching, designing, developing and testing of electronic equipment used in various systems. Electronics and Communications engineers also conceptualize and oversee the manufacturing of communications and broadcast systems. This stream of engineering deals with analogue transmission, basic electronics, microprocessors, solid-state devices, digital and analogue communication, analogue integrated circuits, microwave engineering, satellite communication, antennae and wave progression. It also deals with the manufacturing of electronic devices, circuits, and communications equipment. In India, Electronics and Communications Engineering is offered by various colleges at the UG as well PG level leading to BTech (4 years) and MTech (2 years) degrees respectively. </p></h2><br/><br/><br/>

	<h2><p>For many people, information technology (IT) is basically synonymous with the guys and gals you call when you need help with a computer issue. While that view of information technology isn’t totally wrong, it drastically understates the scope of this critical career field. If you’re looking to get a better handle on what information technology is and the many facets of this field, then you’ve come to the right place. We’ve done the digging for you and spoke with IT industry pros to create this helpful beginner’s guide to the field.</p></h2><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

	<h1>MECHANICAL ENGINEERING:</h1>
	<img src="images/download10.png" width=500px height=300px align="right"/>
	<h2><p>The role of a mechanical engineer is to take a product from an idea to the marketplace. To accomplish this, the mechanical engineer must be able to determine the forces and thermal environment that a product, its parts, or its subsystems will encounter; design them for functionality, aesthetics, and durability; and determine the best manufacturing approach that will ensure operation without failure.Mechanical engineers play key roles in a wide range of industries including automotive, aerospace, biotechnology, computers, electronics, microelectromechanical systems, energy conversion, robotics and automation, and manufacturing. The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) currently lists 36 technical divisions, from advanced energy systems and aerospace engineering to solid-waste engineering and textile engineering.</p></h2><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
